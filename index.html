<p>Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm a Researcher at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt" target="blank">T&eacute;cnico Lisboa </a>&nbsp;
(where I also received my BSc, MSc and most recently, my PhD in Information Systems and Computer Science). There, I work with the
<a href="http://vimmi.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank">Visualization and Intelligent Multimodal Interfaces Group at INESC-ID Lisbon</a>. 
However, my main research position is working in the<a href="http://blackbox.fcsh.unl.pt" target="blank"> Blackbox Project at FCSH </a>, where the result of my PhD research
(and more) is being applied to dance and performing arts scenarios. Current interest topics are video-based rendering, point cloud processing/rendering, 
and recently also VR and AR.</p>
<p>For more details about who I am, what I like, and what I do, I'd encourage clicking the social networks referenced near my portrait or in the contacts section.
They will do a better job than some words here. For anything else, you can send me a nice e-mail which will be replied as soon as I hit F5 on 
Gmail waiting for those journal paper reviews.</p>
<br>
<p>PS: If you landed here looking for my GitHub or software for some paper I have been involved in, I still have not created repositories for 2018 papers (moco and VR annotation), and the MVLDI compressor.
Check again soon, or send me an e-mail. For works I have been involved with other people, you can try <a href="https://github.com/vimmi3d" target"blank">Vimmi3D GitHub page</a>.</p>
